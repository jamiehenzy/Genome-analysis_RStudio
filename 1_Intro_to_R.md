## Get started with swirl ##

Swirl is a program run within R (or RStudio) that introduces you to R features and commands.

### Get set up for the tutorial ###
Request an RStudio session from Explorer, using the OOD interface. Tip: set the time to 2h instead of the default 1h.

Once you've connected to the RStudio server, work in the console window. 

Install swirl:
```
install.packages("swirl")
```
and load the library:
```
library(swirl)
```
Follow the prompts and select "R Programming" for the course. Work through the 15 lessons. At the last prompt for each of the 15 lessons, screenshot what you entered and the first part of the output, and paste into a document. When all 15 last prompts/outputs are captured, save the document as a pdf and upload it to your assignment folder on Explorer.
